This is a final project that I did for my Connections to Computing class. It's a game of battleship in which the player versus a cpu via a server in the terminal. The code is written in C.

Here is an explanation of the code and example play of the game: https://youtu.be/X5eurqcpa04.
The server must be opened using ./server (port number) Ex: ./server 6002 (Shown in demo video).
The client must be opened using ./client localhost (same port number) Ex: ./client localhost 6002 (Shown in demo video).
